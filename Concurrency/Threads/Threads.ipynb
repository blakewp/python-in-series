    "_Concurrency_ means multiple computations are happening at the same time. Imagine on a computer with one CPU core, the operating system rapidly changes which program will be running on the single processor. By doing it so, it overlaps the execution of the programs, providing the illusion that the programs are running simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "A running program is called a _process_. Each process has its own system state, which includes memory, open files, a program counter that keeps track of the instruction being executed, and a call stack used to hold the local variables of functions. Thus characteristics make a process an isolated from other processes on the same machine. Normally, a process executes statements sequentially, which is sometimes called the _main thread_ of the process.\n",

    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this notebook, we're not going to study and look at programming examples about the Processes, because there is a separate conception called _Parallelism_ in which they are involved. I just wanted to mention Processes as they are the foundation on which the Threads lives. Let's not mess up the things and focus on Threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thread**\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a component of a process. A process can contain one or more threads. Threads have their own program counter and register values, but they share the memory space and other resources of the process with other threads.\n",
